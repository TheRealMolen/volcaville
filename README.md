MIDI Interface for VOlcas and friends
=====================================


Designed for an arduino leonardo/micro so it can be a USB midi device

Helps with mapping for plugging a Volca Sample and another instrument
* the Sample uses channels 1-10 (one per sample)
* other instruments should use higher channels
